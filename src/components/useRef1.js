  // useEffect hook is set up without a dependency array. Consequently, it runs on every render.

  //When useEffect doesnâ€™t have a dependency array specified (the second argument), it runs after every render, including the initial render and every re-render that occurs due to changes in state or props.

  //we can change this rendercount.current as much as we want as many times as we want and we'll never ever cause our component to re-render because it's completely separate from our component render cycle. 
  
  //The important thing about ref is it's very very similar to state and that you can store a previous value in it and it persists between different renders but it does not cause you to re-render like state does
